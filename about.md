This website is home to various letterform experiments by Space Type Continuum, a studio run by  [Lynne Yun](https://lynneyun.com) and [Kevin Yeh](kyeh.me). The current project is a series of flourished cards that Lynne made for her Kickstarter project, [Type Design A-Z](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/typedesign/type-design-az).

I have a monthly newsletter that I send out with updates about upcoming talks, classes, current topics of research, and of course updates to this site. [Sign up](https://t.co/xP4XSb9ITu?amp=1) if you'd like to be in the loop.
